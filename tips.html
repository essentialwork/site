      <h1><span>Best Practices</span></h1>
      <p>Essential workers are critical to developing and maintaining
        technological infrastructures. Supporting both the well-being of
        workers and the advancement of emergent workplace systems requires
        attunement to their day-to-day routines and the cadences of existing
        practices.</p>
      <p>This document outlines a set of best practices derived from research
        across essential sectors that seeks to provide organizations considering
        deploying new technologies with a foundation to recognize the role
        essential workers play in introducing and maintaining such
        technologies. </p>

          both the management team and frontline staff with necessary information
          on how the technology functions and appropriate measures to address any
          issues that may arise over the course of operations</li>
        <li><b>Prioritize essential workers’ time:</b> Set times and locations for
          training to ensure that essential workers can take part (e.g., included
          in a daily stand-up meeting or as overtime scheduled in advance with
          associated added compensation)</li>
      </ul>
      <h2><span>2. Measuring expectations versus reality</span></h2>
      <ul>
        <li><b>Understand the existing day-to-day:</b> Chart existing day-to-day
          routines as experienced before the introduction of new technology
          to gain a deeper understanding essential workers’ line of work</li>
        <li><b>Track the accumulation of work:</b> On a regular basis, track
          unexpected tasks that cause deviation from existing tasks or
           accumulation of new forms of work</li>
      </ul>

      <h1><span>Tips for Managers</span></h1>
      <p>Below are a set of worker-centered tools for managers to develop best
        practices for the implementation and maintenance of AI-powered
        technologies. Each activity is  meant to build toward an actionable
        foundation that an organization can adopt and adapt to their own
        needs.</p>
    </span>
    <p><img src="/static/img/resources/red_emphasis_cropped.png">
      <span>In order for these activities to be successful, organizations
        should orient themselves to be: worker-centered, transparent,
        collaborative, responsive and responsible.</span></p>
    <span class="img-rt">
        <div>
          <h2><span>Activity #1: Approach to Training</span></h2>
          <h3>Background / Research Insight:</h3>
          <p>Across essential industries—service, hospitality, retail—we found
            that training was a largely overlooked area in the implementation
            and maintenance of AI-powered technologies. If training did happen,
             it was largely the tech manufacturers who delivered it at the
             time of deployment. However, issues often appeared over time as
            the technology was incorporated into day-to-day operations
            (rather than when it was initially introduced). Additionally,
            training often omitted instructions on how to address the types
            of malfunctions that frontline staff would likely experience
            within the specific material or social context of their work
            environments (e.g., unpredictable performance  in high traffic
            zones). The effort staff made to diagnose and resolve malfunctions
            was often viewed as “extra work” that they felt interfered with
            their day-to-day demands.</p>

        alt="One worker drives a cleaning robot while another stands next to it.">
    </span>
    <span>
      <h3>Scaffolding / Concept:</h3>
      <p>We recommend both managerial staff at the organization and field
         engineers with the technology company have a holistic approach to
         training that takes into account three key aspects that shape the
         implementation and maintenance of AI-powered technologies:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>organizational management</li>
        <li>day-to-day olierations</li>
        <li>on-the-ground action</li>
      </ol>
      <p>Each of these points of interaction address different aspects of
        technologies’ performance, and the distinct set of responsibilities
        needed for a successful roll-out process.</p>

      <h3>Primary Objectives:</h3>
      <p>Develop a training strategy that embeds understanding of
        interconnectedness and collaboration, taking into account different
         types of potential interaction with the technology and existing human
         relationships that make up an organization.</p>

      <h3>Key Takeaways:</h3>
      <p>A well-established training program that equips staff members
         according to their engagement with the technology and existing
          day-to-day routines.</p>

      <h2><span>Activity #2: Coordinating Logistics for Training</span></h2>
      <h3>Background / Research Insight:</h3>
      <p>When training was conducted, we found that essential workers were
         expected to stay after-hours as it was typically scheduled at the
        convenience of the field engineer or managerial staff. Additionally,
        training was often delivered in the style of a tech demonstration,
        rather than a step-by-step walkthrough of how to use and maintain the
        devices. Frontline workers reported that the training did not equip
        them to adequately manage the robots or perform troubleshooting when
        unanticipated errors occurred.</p>
        <h3><span>Scaffolding / Concept:</span></h3>
        <p>We recommend centering three priorities when determining the
          logistics for training sessions, each meant to foreground the
          importance of collaboration to successfully implementing and
          maintaining technologies in the workplace: </p>
        <ol>
          <li>gauge frontline staff’s level of expertise in technological devices
            to identify the point of departure for the training</li>
          <li>center the learning styles of frontline staff when designing the
            training</li>
          <li>work with the trainer to customize the training and topics</li>
          <li>schedule within working hours, prioritizing the schedules of
            staff who work directly with the technology on a day-to-day
            basis.</li>
        </ol>
    </span>
    <span class="img-lt">
      <img class="an4" src="/static/img/resources/protest_sign.png" alt="Worker in a cap
      and safety vest doing a fist salute and holding up an Essential Not
      Disposable sign">
      <div>
        <h3>Primary Objectives:</h3>
        <p>Properly train staff who work directly with the technology by
           prioritizing their schedules, learning styles, and understanding
            of technology. Decrease unnecessary burdens of additional work or
             after-hours activities.</p>
        <h3>Key Takeaways</h3>
        <p>An operations strategy that prepares staff for unexpected
           malfunctions and events will strengthen morale through a practice
            that aims to preserve the dignity and wellbeing of workers.</p>
      </div>
    </span>
    <span>
      <h2><span>Activity #3: Track Progress</span></h2>
      <h3>Background / Research Insight: </h3>
      <p>Our qualitative interviews and observations revealed a disconnect
        between management’s understanding of engaging with the new technologies
        and the day-to-day realities of this interaction for frontline staff.
        Essential workers reported experiencing an accumulation of work due to the
        need to deviate from their routine to remedy or fix regular malfunctions.
        As a result, workers noted increased stress as they struggled to fit the
        additional task of overseeing the new technology into their daily
        routines.</p>
      <h3>Scaffolding / Concept:</h3>
      <p>We recommend formalizing check-ins and accountability measures
        between managerial staff and essential workers to identify areas
         where directives, work allocation, and scope of work are not
         aligned. This includes an active feedback loop that allows workers
         to voice their concerns and demands of the workplace, in addition
          to a partnership with workers’ advocacy groups at the local,
           regional, and national levels.</p>
        <h3>Primary Objectives:</h3>
        <p>An accountability strategy that addresses managerial oversight
           to balance asymmetrical power relations and allows workers to
           voice concerns and recommendations for improved procedures without
           fear of retribution.</p>
        <h3>Key Takeaways: </h3>
        <p>Identify technology malfunctions that are creating additional
          work for the essential workers, and balance daily or weekly
          assignments so that essential workers’ initial scope of work
          remains the same. </p>
        <h2><span>Activity #4: Feedback</span></h2>
        <h3>Background / Research Insight:</h3>
        <p>From our participatory design workshops, essential workers expressed
           a sense of relief as they voiced their concerns and identified
           inconsistencies between administrative directives and their
           day-to-day realities, in addition to ways to potentially address
           these widening gaps.
        <h3>Scaffolding / Concept: </h3>
        <p>We recommend creating formalized feedback and listening
           sessions that incorporate the principles of: </p>
        <ol>
          <li>non-hierarchical collaboration</li>
          <li>active participation</li>
          <li>institutional transparency</li>
          <li>anonymity of the worker</li>
        </ol>
        <p>We recommend having a third party to facilitate this process.
          Meetings may take place in a room separate from common areas in a
          location and at a time convenient for all parties during working
          hours. A third party will facilitate the intake of anonymized
          feedback and share essential workers’ insights on a regular basis
          without indication of the workers’ identity. We recommend having
          these meetings once every quarter, as well as at the request
           of frontline workers.</p>
    </span>

      alt="person holding an unidentifiable tool">
      <div>
        <h3>Primary Objective</h3>
        <p>Develop a co-design strategy and set of accountability measures
           that heighten efficiency and morale by creating a space for workers
            to receive updates and give feedback continuously.</p>

        <h3>Key Takeaways:</h3>
        <p>Keeping organizational administrators and managerial staff
          accountable. Frontline workers have the opportunity to voice
          their concerns via a process that actively seeks to translate
          their feedback into actionable steps for the institution.
          Develop a co-design strategy and set of accountability measures
          that heighten efficiency and morale by creating a space for workers
          to receive updates and give feedback continuously.</p>
      </div>
    </span>
    <span>
      <h2><span>Activity #5: Communication Across All Parties</span></h2>
      <h3>Background / Research Insight: </h3>
      <p>From our observations, we found that the roll-out and
         maintenance process involved multiple actors who didn’t have
         formalized strategies for communicating with one another.
         Essential workers, especially, reported finding themselves
         continually guessing next steps as they managed the daily care
         and periodic repair of the devices. This resulted in
         workers associating the new technology with negative feelings
         and a sense of dismissal.</p>
      <h3>Scaffolding / Concept:</h3>
      <p>We recommend formalizing a communication schedule across all actors, with
  particular focus on the relationship between essential workers and field
  engineers. This would involve reserving specific days and times to have
  regular check-ins and/or a formalized channel to communicate the need for
  repairs. In addition, we also recommend coordinating with the tech vendor to
  work with a reliable, locally owned maintenance company for smaller scale
  repairs and daily maintenance, as such firms are more likely to have existing
  rapport with staff and address issues in a timely manner. </p>
      <h3>Primary Objectives:</h3>
      <p>A communication and operations strategy that formalizes ways to spotlight
issues across rank and third-party local maintenance and repair companies. </p>
<h3>Key Takeaways:</h3>
<p> Establish regular lines of communication around repair and maintenance
across the organization, as well as with the tech vendor and local third party
repair company.</p>
